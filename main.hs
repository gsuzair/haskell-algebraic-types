-- 6.1.1.  The simplest sort of algebraic type is defined by enumeration. For example:
-- data Season = Spring | Summer | Autumn | Winter
-- deriving (Eq, Show, Enum)
-- Program a constant function theSeasons of type [Season] containing all of the seasons in order,
-- starting with Spring

-- Enum a => a -> [a] -> on hoogle -> enumFrom :: a -> [a] can be used for this question
